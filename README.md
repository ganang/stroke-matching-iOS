# SwiftUI with C++ & Bazel: StrokeMatching

This repository showcases the implementation of Stroke Matching, a gesture recognition feature to match the user-drawn strokes, using SwiftUI integrated with C++ and Bazel.

# Repository Contents:

- SwiftUI views and components designed for interactive gesture input using PencilKit.
- C++ algorithms for Stroke Matching computation.
- Bazel configuration files for project setup and building.

# Usage:
Clone the repository and explore the implementation details in each component. Modify and extend the codebase to integrate Stroke Matching into your own iOS projects.

# Video Demo

# Next Plan:
- Develop a web tutorial on implementing Stroke Matching.
